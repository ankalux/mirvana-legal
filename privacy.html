  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: April 2025</p>

  <p>At Mirvana, your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Images:</strong> Uploaded images are used only for temporary AI processing. They are not stored or shared.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous User ID:</strong> An ID is generated via Firebase to anonymously track daily usage limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Metrics:</strong> We track how many images each user generates per day to enforce limits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase (by Google) for anonymous authentication and Firestore database. We use Replicate to generate AI images based on the uploaded photos.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We do not store your photos. Your usage data (e.g., how many images you've generated) is stored anonymously in our database.</p>

  <h2>GDPR Rights</h2>
  <p>If you are located in the EU, you have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your data. Since data is anonymous, please include your app User ID if contacting us.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have privacy-related questions or want your anonymous data removed, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@ankalux.org">privacy@ankalux.org</a>.</p>
